# Page using markdown

## The concept

By default, Sphinx uses reStructuredText, the files used end with .rst.

For example, for this test project, "My first Sphinx page!" has its own file.rst file. And "Page using markdown" - this page- has a markdown file to generate it.

And since markdown is very well-known, it feels more natural than to use reStructuredText.

## Reference

As it is explained in this other [documentation by read the docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html), you can also use markdown pages (.md), wich I am more familiar with.

To use the functionality, you need to install: 

```
pip install myst-parser
```
