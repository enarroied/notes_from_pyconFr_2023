.. _introduction: 
My first Sphinx page!
=======================

Context
-------

This is a page creeated for my notes following the Pycon Fr 2023!

I had never used Sphinx before, but I sure have seen many documentation 
pages done with it. Big thanks to Edith Viau, whose conference about 
documentation mentioned Sphinx.

Ressources
----------

But guess what, her conference, which was so great by the way, was not 
about how to use sphinx. And since I wanted to try it out, I followed 
the following 2 ressources :
1. The official SPhinx documentation
2. This tutorial by **Audrey Tavares**: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE72UCmIe7T9HewaqCUhKqiMK3LxYStjy

The tutorail is so great! Big thanks to Audrey Tavares!

.. admonition:: Be careful!
   
   This is by no means a tutorial, just a personal exploration on the topic of how to create Sphinx pages.
